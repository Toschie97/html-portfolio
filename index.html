    <p>
        Hi! My Name is Lachlan, but I usually go by Lachie (either is fine!)<br>
        I'm currently completeing a Master of Business Analytics at La Trobe Univertsity.<br>
        Alongside this, I'm undertaking self directed learning across a number of topics, such as<br>
        Web Development, Computer Science and Programming to name a few.<br>
        This is just a small attempt at a live website; nothing too serious!
